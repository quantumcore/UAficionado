The Idea for this is that. For beginners in Cyber Security, Red Team Vs Blue Team tasks are very hard. Especially for People who are learning by them selves.

UAficionado is the Red Team, You have to stop it from getting inside your Network (The Concept). You are the Blue Team.
UAficionado has 5 levels.
* Find a Backdoor they planted on your Computer. Reverse Engineer it to reveal the Host. 
* Scan the Host for Vulnerabilites, And Exploit it.
* Stop the DOS Server.
* Find the Identity of the Person attacking. 
* The End.
